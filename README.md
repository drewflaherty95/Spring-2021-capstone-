# Spring-2021-capstone-

This project focuses on the effects of company financial information on the scale at which they report (i.e.ones, thousands, millions of dollars). Specifically, the focus was to determine why companies switch from one reporting denomination to another. The analyis of the problem was done through both exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. The data was pulled from the SEC edgar database. The files in this README contain the code used in the completion of this project from data collection to modeling.
